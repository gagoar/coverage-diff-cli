## Installation

### NPX

```bash

```

### NPM (global)

```bash
  npm -g install coverage-diff-cli

  npm run coverage-diff-cli results --baseLocation <base_summary.json> --headLocation <head_summary.json>
```

### YARN (global)

  yarn global add coverage-diff-cli

  coverage-diff-cli results --baseLocation <base_summary.json> --headLocation <head_summary.json>
```

### Binary

If you don't want any dependencies, you can use the binary directly.

Head over to [releases](https://github.com/gagoar/coverage-diff-cli/releases/latest) and pick the binary for LINUX, MACOSX and WINDOWS.

## Getting Started

This cli exposes 3 main functionalities coming directly from [coverage-dff](https://github.com/flaviusone/coverage-diff) project.

the `base` and `head` parameters are a standard output from istanbul code coverage tool called [json-summary](https://istanbul.js.org/docs/advanced/alternative-reporters/#json-summary).

> if you are using jest (that comes already with istanbul inside) you can just specify the `--coverageReporters` via [command line](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/cli) or via the [configuration](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/23.x/configuration#coveragereporters-arraystring).

```bash
Usage: coverage-diff-cli [options] [command]

ðŸš¦ command line tool to report diff coverage ðŸš¦

Options:
  -V, --version                                           output the version number
  -b --baseLocation <path/to/the/base/json-summary.json>  The base summary (frequently on master/main branch), for more details: https://istanbul.js.org/docs/advanced/alternative-reporters/#json-summary
  -h --headLocation <path/to/the/head/json-summary.json>  The head summary (frequently coming from changes in a PR), for more details:
                                                          https://istanbul.js.org/docs/advanced/alternative-reporters/#json-summary
  --help                                                  display help for command

Commands:
  diff                                                    It will return a diff (json format) between base and head summary diffs
  regression                                              It will exit with 0 or 1 if was a regression or not
  results                                                 It will display a markdown table with the differential and regressions
  help [command]                                          display help for command
```

### Diff

It will return a json object displaying the differential between these 2 summaries. (you can see the type of the response [ICoverageSummary](#diff-response-type))

```bash
  npx coverage-diff diff --baseLocation <base_summary.json> --headLocation <head_summary.json>
```

### Regression

The command line will exit with `1` if there has been a regression, useful when trying to request changes on a PR.

```bash
  npx coverage-diff regression --base --baseLocation <base_summary.json> --headLocation <head_summary.json>
```

### Results

Visual output of results. (markdown). Ideal for posting directly in github PR.

```bash
  npx coverage-diff results --baseLocation <base_summary.json> --headLocation <head_summary.json>
```

It will produce an output such as this:

|     | Ok                     | File             | Lines            | Branches      | Functions        | Statements |
| --- | ---------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | ------------- | ---------------- | ---------- |
| âœ…  | /absolute/path/file.ts | 100%<br>(+5.41%) | 100%<br>(+9.09%) | 100%<br>(+0%) | 100%<br>(+5.41%) |

Total:

| Lines        | Branches     | Functions | Statements   |
| ------------ | ------------ | --------- | ------------ |
| 100%(+3.51%) | 100%(+9.09%) | 100%(+0%) | 100%(+3.39%) |

## Details

### Diff response type

the diff action on the cli will return a json response of the following shape:

```typescript
export interface ICoverageSummary {
  lines: ICoverageInfo;
  statements: ICoverageInfo;
  functions: ICoverageInfo;
  branches: ICoverageInfo;
}

export interface ICoverageInfo {
  total: number;
  covered: number;
  skipped: number;
  pct: number;
}
```
